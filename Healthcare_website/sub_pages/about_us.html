        <h1>About us</h1><br><br>
        <p>An institution that is built, staffed, and equipped for the diagnosis of disease; for the treatment,</p>
        <p>Both medical and surgical, of the sick and the injured; and for their housing during this process.</p>
        <p>The modern hospital also often serves as a centre for investigation and for teaching.</p>

        <p>To better serve the wide-ranging needs of the community,the modern hospital </p>
        <p>Has often developed outpatient facilities, as well as emergency, psychiatric,and rehabilitation services.</p>
        <p>In addition, “bedless hospitals” provide strictly ambulatory (outpatient) care and day surgery.</p>
        <p>Patients arrive at the facility for short appointments They may also stay for treatment in surgical or medical units</p>
        <p>For part of a day or for a full day, </p>
        <p>After which they are discharged for follow-up by a primary care health provider.</p>
            
        <p> Hospitals have long existed in most countries. </p>
        <p>Developing countries, which contain a large proportion of the world’s population,</p>
        <p>Generally do not have enough hospitals,equipment,</p>
        <p>And trained staff to handle the volume of persons who need care Thus, people in these countries do not always receive the</p>
        <p>Benefits of modern medicine, health measures, or hospital care,and they generally have lower life expectancies.</p> <br><br>
